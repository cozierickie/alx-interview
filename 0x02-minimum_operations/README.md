# Minimum Operations

## Overview

This project solves the "Minimum Operations" problem in Python, where the goal is to find the fewest operations needed to reach exactly `n` characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, the function `minOperations(n)` returns the minimum number of operations required to reach exactly `n` characters. If `n` can't be achieved, it returns `0`.

### Example

For `n = 9`:
- Operations: `Copy All` -> `Paste` -> `Paste` -> `Copy All` -> `Paste` -> `Paste`
- Number of operations: `6`

## Requirements

- Code in Python, compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- Includes a mandatory `README.md`

## Repository

- **Directory**: `0x02-minimum_operations`
- **File**: `0-minoperations.py`
