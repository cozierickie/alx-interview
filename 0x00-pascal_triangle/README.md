# Pascal's Triangle

## Description

This project involves creating a Python function that generates Pascal's Triangle, a mathematical structure used in various combinatorial contexts. The triangle is constructed by summing adjacent elements from the previous row, and each row starts and ends with 1.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Revisit fundamental Python concepts such as lists, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- Practice implementing algorithms and understanding their efficiency.
- Learn about Pascal's Triangle and its applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- All code should be written in Python.
The function must be implemented in the file `0-pascal_triangle.py`.

## Project Structure

├── 0-pascal_triangle.py # The implementation of the Pascal's Triangle function
└── 0-main.py # A test script to demonstrate the functionality


## Usage

### Function Signature

```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Returns a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle of height n.
    """
